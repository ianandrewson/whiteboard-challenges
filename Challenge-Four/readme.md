A friend has a bunch of files on their computer that they need to rename.

Each file contains a single word. This word does not matter.

Your friend wants to rename each file so that the new file name takes the following format: ${FILE_CONTENT}-${OLD_FILE_NUMBER}-${LAST_MODIFIED_DATETIME}. (e.g. shade-1-2019-06-19T15:52:05.420Z)



    design a solution (in english what do you need to do)
    break down the problem into smaller chunks
    start working on chunks
        define an outcome (how do you know when the chunk is complete)
        define a validation (write a test)
        write code
        validate code (test passes)
        commit
        read code and refactor
        commit
        repeat for next chunk
